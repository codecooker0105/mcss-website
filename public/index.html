    <strong> MCSS, McGill Chinese Students’ Society is the largest and most influential cultural 
      student organization in Eastern Canada. With over 15 events per year and 55 years of history, 
      we provide a variety of events to our over 1,500 active members and help our members succeed 
      in school and life. Our short-term goal is to provide our students with valuable events to make 
      their student life more meaningful, while our long-term goal is to motivate and encourage our 
      students to give back to their community and excel academically by providing them with helpful 
      services including seminars, lessons, and talks. Our past events have included ski trips, casino nights, 
      semi-formals, city-wide races to many more. Join us this year for even more excitement and fun! </strong>
